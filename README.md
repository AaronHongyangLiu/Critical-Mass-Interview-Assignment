# Critical-Mass-Interview-Assignment

## Work / Project Examples:

- <i>Barcode Scanner</i>
    ```
     This is a project I had in March 2018 at my current intern place, CME lab at UofA. 
     This project is an Android App for storing and retrieving information by scanning barcode.
     The backend api server for this App is set up on a cloud vm and is using ExpressJS with MongoDB.
     I'm the only developer for this App. I built it from scratch.
    ```  
- <i>IoT Sensor Cloud</i>
   ```
   This is a project I had in September 2017 at my current intern place, CME lab at UofA.
   This project is a Web Application for monitering and analysing the data sent from sensors in our lab.
   This project is supposed to work as a support application to the sensors built in the lab.
   The frontend is built wiht React+Redux and the backend is Django.
   I'm also the only developer for this project and built it from scratch. 
   ```

## Inspiration:
I was trying to find a good curve fitting library in C# the other day, and I came across this [csmpfit](https://github.com/cureos/csmpfit) project. 

This is a c# makeover of a C-based library. The purpose of this porject, which is just to provide an interface to a library that's targeting at a differet language, inspirs me a little bit. I know there are lots of "makeover" libraries. Why don't we just porvide some sort of "translator" that could translate any foreign language library instead of a specific one, to a native language so it could be used.

## Focus:
If I could build/learn anything I could, I'm thinking about building some machine learining related projects. 

I'll firstly need to learn the basics of machine learning, of cource. Then, I want to build something that could "learn" some perodic data (e.g. weather reports for the 10 years) so that it could reconginze some points or data that are "unnatural" which chould have some special meanings (e.g. weather after a huge fire). 

This is just a rough idea I have in my mind right now. I'll definitely need to do some researches to see if there already are things similar and things that could be useful.

## Code Challenge:
Both funciton returns the result array, [Link here](https://codepen.io/aaroncoolliu/pen/pLYvQq)
