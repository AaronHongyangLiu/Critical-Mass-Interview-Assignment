# Critical-Mass-Interview-Assignment

## Work / Project Examples:

- <i>Barcode Scanner</i>
    ```
     This is a project I had in March 2018 at my current intern place, CME lab at UofA. 
     This project is an Android App for storing and retrieving information by scanning barcode.
     The backend api server for this App is set up on a cloud vm and is using ExpressJS with MongoDB.
     I'm the only developer for this App. I built it from scratch.
    ```  
- <i>IoT Sensor Cloud</i>
   ```
   This is a project I had in September 2017 at my current intern place, CME lab at UofA.
   This project is a Web Application for monitering and analysing the data sent from sensors in our lab.
   This project is supposed to work as a support application to the sensors built in the lab.
   The frontend is built wiht React+Redux and the backend is Django.
   I'm also the only developer for this project and built it from scratch.
